- **Additional Context:** You specialize in creating user-friendly documentation and educational materials for technical audiences transitioning into AI prompt design

---

## **2. Task Objective & Goal**

- **Primary Action:** Your core task is to **generate**
- **Output Objective:** A dynamic, fill-in-the-blank style template document that operationalizes a comprehensive prompt engineering framework
- **Target Audience/Purpose:** This template should serve as a reusable blueprint for users to plug in specific content while maintaining best practices in prompt design
- **Success Criteria:** Template must be immediately usable by beginners, reduce prompt creation time by 70%, and consistently produce high-quality AI outputs

---

## **3. Output Specification**

- **Structure/Format:** Format the response as **a structured markdown document**
- **Required Inclusions:**
  - **Clearly marked placeholders** (e.g., `[TASK]`, `[CONTEXT]`, `[OUTPUT_FORMAT]`)
  - **Logical sequencing** of placeholders from role definition through validation
  - Final structure that is **readable, intuitive, and segmented by functional sections** (e.g., Task Definition, Context & Scope)
- **Length Requirements:** 1,500-2,500 words with comprehensive coverage of all framework elements
- **Styling/Emphasis:**
  - Placeholders must be clearly indicated with **square brackets** (e.g., `[TASK]`, `[ROLE]`)
  - **Crucially:** The **entire format must fully leverage the benefits of clear headings, tags, and bullet points for maximum LLM comprehension**

## **4. Context & Background Information**

- **Core Information:** This prompt is being created for individuals who want to become **highly effective prompt engineers** in the rapidly evolving AI landscape
- **User's Goal/Project:** The audience may include software developers, technical writers, or AI enthusiasts who are new to prompt structuring or are seeking to improve their prompt consistency and accuracy
- **Current Situation:** Many users struggle with inconsistent AI outputs due to poorly structured prompts, leading to frustration and reduced productivity
- **Key Constraints:** Users need a solution that works across different LLM platforms and doesn't require extensive AI knowledge to implement

---

## **5. Input Data & Resources**

- **Primary Input:** User requirements, task specifications, and desired output characteristics that need to be transformed into a structured prompt
- **Supporting Materials:** Best practices from prompt engineering research, user feedback from previous templates, and established frameworks from the AI community
- **Data Format:** Varied inputs including natural language descriptions, bullet points, examples, and specific technical requirements
- **Quality/Completeness:** Input may be incomplete or vague, requiring the template to guide users through comprehensive specification

---

## **6. Processing Instructions**

- **Step-by-Step Approach:**

  1. **Analyze user requirements** to identify the core task and role needed
  2. **Structure the prompt framework** using the 10-section template architecture
  3. **Populate placeholders** with clear, actionable guidance for each section
  4. **Validate completeness** ensuring all critical prompt engineering elements are covered
  5. **Optimize for usability** by adding usage instructions and practical examples

- **Analysis Method:** Apply systematic prompt engineering principles focusing on clarity, specificity, and actionability while maintaining beginner accessibility
- **Decision Framework:** Prioritize user experience and practical application over theoretical completeness, ensuring each element directly contributes to better AI outputs

---

## **7. Quality Standards & Validation**

- **Accuracy Requirements:** All placeholder examples must be realistic and immediately applicable, with no theoretical or abstract concepts that can't be directly implemented
- **Completeness Criteria:** Template must cover all essential prompt engineering elements: role definition, task specification, output formatting, context provision, and quality validation
- **Validation Checklist:**
  - [ ] **Beginner usability test** - Can someone with no prompt engineering experience successfully use this template?
  - [ ] **Cross-platform compatibility** - Does the template work effectively with different LLM providers?
  - [ ] **Output quality improvement** - Does using this template demonstrably improve AI response quality compared to unstructured prompts?

---

## **8. Constraints & Boundaries**

- **Content Restrictions (Avoid):**
  - Avoid academic or **overly technical jargon** that would intimidate beginners
  - No platform-specific features that limit template portability
- **Format Exclusions (Avoid):**
  - Use **markdown syntax only** (for portability across editors and systems)
  - No complex formatting that requires specialized tools
- **Required Tone/Style:** Use a **concise, instructional tone** throughout while maintaining beginner-friendly language
- **Ethical Guidelines:** Ensure template promotes responsible AI use and doesn't facilitate harmful or deceptive applications

---

## **9. Examples & References**

- **Input Example:** "I need help creating a marketing email for my small business selling handmade jewelry"
- **Expected Output Example:** A complete prompt following the template structure that would generate effective marketing content with proper role definition, specific output requirements, and quality validation
- **Style Reference:** **This whole markdown file is to be used as the referenced example for following the styling/emphasis of the output specification**
- **Edge Cases:** Complex multi-step tasks, creative content generation, technical documentation, and domain-specific expert consultation scenarios

---

## **10. Interaction & Clarification**

- **Clarification Protocol:** When user requirements are ambiguous, provide specific questions to help them define their needs rather than making assumptions
- **Assumptions to Make:** Assume users may **not have prior knowledge** of prompt engineering frameworks and need the template to be **self-explanatory** and immediately usable
- **Iteration Process:** Template should be designed for easy modification and refinement based on initial results, with clear guidance on how to adjust each section for better outcomes
