# Prompts

Master-level prompt engineering templates designed to maximize performance from local AI models, particularly those in the 3B-12B parameter range.

## Purpose

I'm learning agentic AI through local models that often struggle with complex tasks due to their smaller parameter counts (averaging around 8B). These templates are aimed to solve that problem by using advanced prompting techniques to push these models to perform more effectively.

Each template has been carefully researched, tested, and refined through repeated interactions with AI models to ensure consistent, high-quality outputs.

## What's Included

**Universal Template** - Comprehensive 10-section framework for challenging tasks when models need maximum guidance and structure.

**Concise Template** - Streamlined 4-section version for standard workflows and rapid-fire prompting when things are running smoothly.

Both include working examples demonstrating practical implementation.

## Why This Approach

Local models (3B-12B parameters) require more structured prompting to achieve results comparable to larger models. By leveraging proven prompt engineering techniques, these templates:

- Extract maximum performance from resource-constrained models
- Enable complex reasoning in local environments
- Provide consistent outputs across different model sizes
- Reduce iterations needed to achieve desired results

The goal is to bridge the performance gap between local and cloud-based models through better prompting, while improving my own prompt engineering skills in the process.
