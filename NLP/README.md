# NLP-Learning

## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey into Natural Language Processing (NLP), a key AI subfield focusing on computer-human language interaction. As I progress through my NLP course, I'm using this space to catalog concepts, code snippets, and insights. It serves as my personal learning log and reference guide for NLP techniques in text analysis and generation.
